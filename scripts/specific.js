La Salle’s route in 1679 starts in Montreal and goes south, through Lake Ontario and Lake Erie, and then loops north, around Michigan, ending in Peoria, Illinois. La Salle’s route in 1682 starts in Peoria and goes south, along the Mississippi River and the Kentucky and Illinois border. Large swaths of color show English, French, and Spanish claims. <ul><li>The English claims area is almost the entire East coast, including several major cities like New York and Philadelphia. The English claims area goes from southern Maine to just north of Florida. The area extends from the coast in toward the Appalachian Mountains. Another English claims area covers much of Southern Canada, with a dip into Minnesota and North Dakota. </li><li>The French claims area is most of the Midwest and some of the South, including Kentucky and Louisiana. It goes from north of Quebec, to Louisiana in the south, and Idaho in the west.</li><li>The Spanish claims area is all of Florida and the southern parts of Georgia and Alabama. Another Spanish claims area is most of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, with a small portion in Southern California, and most of Northern Mexico.</li><li>The rest of the present-United States, mostly the northwestern states, is not claimed.</li><ul>",
